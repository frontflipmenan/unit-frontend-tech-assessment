# Assessment!

Wow that was interesting. It's a little messy from trying to get as much done as possible in 2 hours.

I did not have enough time to set up the postal code API endpoint properly to update shipping information.
I've never professionally set up API endpoints before so I actually learned quite a bit doing this assessment.
In the past all of my API endpoints were set up for me, and I spent quite a while just getting the first one done in this project.

Anyways! Thanks for checking this out, hope to hear back!
